            <h1>Why I Ditched Windows, Burned the ISO, and Entered the Linux Cult</h1>
            
            <p><em>"They told me Linux was for hackers and weirdos. They were right. So I installed it."</em></p>

            <p>I don't know when it happened. Maybe it was the 38th unwanted Windows update or the way Edge forced itself into my startup like a clingy ex. But something in me snapped.</p>

            <p>I needed out.<br>
            Out of bloat.<br>
            Out of telemetry.<br>
            Out of the Big Tech zoo.</p>

            <h2>The First Taste: Linux Mint Cinnamon</h2>
            <p>So I dipped my toes into the shallow end: Linux Mint Cinnamon. Friendly UI. Stable. Felt like Ubuntu but without the annoying pop-ups and pretentious energy.</p>

            <p>But then‚Ä¶<br>
            I saw it.<br>
            A riced Arch desktop on r/unixporn.</p>

            <p>It was over.</p>

            <h2>Enter the Void: Ricing and the Terminal Cult</h2>
            <p>No one tells you what ricing really means. It's not just "customizing your desktop."<br>
            It's <em>philosophy</em>. It's minimalism mixed with madness. It's staring at your i3 config file for 2 hours just to make your volume keys work.</p>

            <p>I went from GUI baby mode to living in the terminal. File managers? I <em>am</em> the file manager.</p>

            <p>Bash became my prayer.<br>
            Neovim, my scroll.<br>
            And when I booted into a black screen with no cursor after updating GRUB?<br>
            That was my baptism.</p>

            <h2>Why I Stayed</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My system only runs what <em>I</em> install.</li>
                <li>No forced updates, no spyware, no bullsh*t.</li>
                <li>I started <em>understanding</em> how operating systems work ‚Äî not just clicking buttons.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Most of all? It felt like <em>mine</em>.<br>
            I wasn't just using tech. I was <em>co-creating</em> it.</p>

            <h2>For Devs Thinking of Switching</h2>
            <p>Do it. Break things. Reinstall 5 times. Cry. RTFM. Rise.<br>
            It'll make you a better developer, guaranteed. You'll learn networking, scripting, file structures, permission systems ‚Äî all by necessity. No more "dev mode." Just <em>real mode</em>.</p>

            <h3>Last words:</h3>
            <blockquote>
                "Linux didn't just change my OS. It gave me back control. In a world of autoplay, that's priceless."
            </blockquote>
